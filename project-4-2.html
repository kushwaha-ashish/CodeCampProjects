<!--User Story #4: I can see dots, that each have a class of dot, which represent the data being plotted.
User Story #5: Each dot should have the properties data-xvalue and data-yvalue containing their corresponding x and y values.
User Story #7: The data-xvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis.
User Story #8: The data-yvalue and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis.
User Story #9: I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with %M:%S time format.
User Story #10: I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year.
User Story #11: I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data.
User Story #12: I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data.

User Story #14: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
